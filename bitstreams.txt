You'll need 7zip to uncompress them and IMPACT from the xilinx ISE to program. Download
and install the full version (not Webpack). No licence is needed to run IMPACT, at
least for ISE 14.4 on XP-SP3 (which is my ancient parallel-port PC I use for IMPACT).
Also a xilinx JTAG platform cable. The official one is very expensive, cheap clones
are available on ebay, or if you can do electronics a parallel-port adapter can be
built for just a few dollars.
